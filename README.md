# Purpose and Learning Outcomes

### Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to apply pre-trained object detection models, specifically YOLOv8, to analyze visual data and detect relevant objects within an image. By leveraging computer vision, this project enables automatic identification of various objects such as birds, airplanes, and other entities from photographic input. The key objective is to demonstrate the practical application of AI vision models in real-world use cases such as wildlife monitoring, drone surveillance, or automated labeling systems.

### Learning Outcomes
Upon completing this project, the following learning outcomes were achieved:

Familiarization with YOLOv8 Architecture
Gained hands-on experience using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection model, including loading pretrained weights and interpreting detection results.
Object Detection & Class Filtering
Learned to filter specific object classes (e.g., bird) based on confidence thresholds, and visualize results through bounding boxes and labels.
Image Annotation and Exportation
Developed skills in annotating images using OpenCV, converting between color spaces (BGR ↔ RGB), and exporting processed images for downstream tasks or reporting.
Effective Visualization Techniques
Practiced using matplotlib and OpenCV for clear visualization of object detection outputs in different formats: all objects, specific classes, and original input for comparison.
Python Scripting & Colab Usage
Improved Python coding proficiency within the Google Colab environment, including integrating packages like ultralytics, opencv-python, and matplotlib.
